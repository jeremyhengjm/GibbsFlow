Bayesian mixture model
- Run reference SMC sampler using demo_ais.R 
- Run demo_gibbsvelocity.R to investigate stiffness of ODE
- Run run_gibbsflow_repeats.R to generate trajectories under the Gibbs flow and by combining Gibbs flow with HMC
- Run analyze_gibbsflow_integration.R and plot_gibbsflow_results.R to generate the figures in the paper
