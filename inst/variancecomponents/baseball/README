Variance component model on baseball dataset
- Run demo_gibbsvelocity.R to investigate stiffness of Gibbs flow
- Run demo_ais.R, demo_gibbsflow_sis.R and demo_gibbsflow_ais.R files to see how each method performs on this model
- Run repeat files using repeats.R followed by analyse_results.R to compare performance
